## Comments, questions and suggestions.

### Relevance
In the context of software engineering  for AI, and its complex models and applications, the concern with modularity is important and deserves investigation.

### Novelty 
The authors report that there is not a related (systematic) study that exploits modularity in the context of NN literature.

### Soundness 


### Transparency

Github anonymous is used to provide a repository with research artifacts generated and used during the study.
